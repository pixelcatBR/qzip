Hi, I'm pixelcat and I created qzip.
I created qzip to learn about Python modules. I 
found the Python documentation very difficult, so 
I studied a bit with other non-Python documentation
(videos, lessons, courses) and made this code.

## how to install

first create venv:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```
and execute code:
```
python3 main.py
```

## What does qzip do?

- create zips

- unzip zips

- error mensages

## how to contribute:

- Adding interface improvements
- improvements to zip file creation
- syntax improvements
- among other enhancements.
